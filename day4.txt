Day 4 of 100
------------------

So today was a busy day for me with helping my parents move and all those logistics with the moving truck, BUT I still managed to study for almost 2 hrs ( im proud of myself )!

So today I continued with some database review from things I learned in school about MySQL I finished that basic module ( since this course plans on focusing more on MongoDB ). It was a good refresher and really the power of MySQL and its relations is still so powerful and crazy what a well set up database can accomplish with such speed.

After the MySQL section I started on the MongoDB part but only really got through the initial set up ( kind of disappointed I didn't get more done ). Is it just me or does anyone else dread setting up new technologies / environments, I always get stressed something won't be set up right. Thankfully everything went smoothly and had no issues with that. 

Tomorrow I will be continuing with MongoDB and other things ahead! Hopefully I get more done although I might be roped into helping move more.
