Day 2 of 100
------------------

Today is day 2 of my 100 days of code challenge!

Today I worked on the final EJS challenge a bit more as well as reading some suggested documentation about Routes and Route parameters http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html

I made my post on Twitter today @Dtaghavi and attended a Zoom meetup about Next.js which was described as a Framework for the React Framework. This was a bit ahead of my current knowledge ( since I haven't even learned React yet ) but it was good information non the less.

My thoughts after today are I need to up the amount of time I am investing in this and during the time make a concerted effort to not get distracted by anything else in that time to really take advantage and feel okay with saying I did X for this amount of time.
