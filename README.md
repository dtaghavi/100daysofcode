# 100 Days of Code
I will be starting the 100 Days of Code challenge.
As part of the challenge I will be posting on Twitter @Dtaghavi about the things I learnig that day. 

I will be spending a minimum of 1 hr per day and as a way to improve my discipline I am doing this publicly.

In addition to posting on Twitter I wanted to improve my discipline with using Git more so I will be posting here daily as well.
Since I am limited to the number of characters on Twitter I will be posting a bit more of my thoughts and the things I went over at the end of the day
here on Git Hub.
