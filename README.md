# 100 Days of Code
I will be starting the 100 Days of Code challenge. As part of the challenge I will be posting on Twitter @Dtaghavi about the things I am learning that day. 

I will be spending a minimum of 1 hr per day coding/learning, and as a way to improve my discipline I am doing this publicly.

In addition to posting on Twitter I wanted to improve my discipline with using Git more so I will be posting here daily as well.
Since I am limited to the number of characters on Twitter I will be posting a bit more of my thoughts and the things I went over at the end of the day
here on Git Hub.

Initially I will be working on "The Complete 2020 Web Developer Bootcamp" created by @LondonAppBrewer which I purchased from Udemy.

From there I will take that knowledge and create my own CV. Afterwards I will decide what technologies / languages I would like a better understanding of or more information.

My ultimate goal in all of this is to make use of my Bachelors in Computer Science and start my career in the tech industry by landing my first developer job.
In recent time I have grown to like web dev so that is where I am starting my post grad education. I also believe to be a successful developer I need to start coding daily due to how quickly the industry changes, so I can stay fresh.
