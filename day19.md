Day 19 of 100
------------------

Day 19 Complete!!!

I did a couple problems today on Firecode.io and felt slightly defeated after my last one, a topic I used to know very well and something I feel I should have been able to solve on my own. ( needed to watch a video to help solve it.)

The problem was validating a BST. A BST is a tree where the children on the left are less than that of the parent and the children on the right are greater than the parent, and each node can only have two children. The idea of these trees is to make searching very quick O(logn) because you'd immediately be able to cut out half of n nodes from your first comparison.

Anyways I tried solving it on my own and I knew there was some sort of recursion involved I just couldn't remember what exactly to do. So I messed around with it for a bit and even reviewed the three types of tree traversals: In-Order ( Left, Root, Right ), Pre-Order: ( Root, Left, Right ), and Post Order: (Left, Right, Root) but still couldn't solve it. So I read the hints ( which is basically an answer ) and I STILL messed it up, although very minor. So I watched a YouTube video and found a solution and finally understood where I was slipping up.

So while yes I was upset about not being able to solve this I suppose this kind of works in my favor, I got to review different traversal methods AND learned how to validate a BST. So while is it frustrating I guess this is the goal.

Anyways other than that I did a couple other problems and refreshed on the idea of Dynamic Programming ( Not solving the same problem twice, but storing the data and using that already calculated data in your present calculations. ) Learned a lot about this in an Algorithms class way too much to talk about here but glad to see old concepts I learned about coming up already.

So overall today was good but since starting this new job I need to find a way to allocate more time to this during the day because doing this so late at night after I've worked all day is kind of rough and unproductive. ( or not as unproductive as I feel I could be during the day )
