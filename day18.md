Day 18 of 100
------------------

We are back! Day 18 Complete!

I know you're not supposed to miss a day that's kind of the point of this 100 days of code. But life doesn't always go as planned, and I am not stopping because of that.

( Slightly personal edition )

Mid COVID I stopped working at my restaurant as a Bartender (where I was making enough money and never had to worry about my income) and moved across the country to Florida to stay near my family. Since I've been out here I wanted to make some changes in my life and really put my degree to use so I started this challenge ( after weeks of basically doing it already. In an attempt to get my skills to where I feel they could land me a job. ) Since then I've now gotten my first web development client and had a couple interviews for full time junior positions. I haven't landed a developer job yet but at least things are moving in the right direction.  

But.....

I was avoiding getting back into the restaurant industry and was living on my savings in the mean time while I put a concerted effort into this goal. I am now near the end of my savings so in these past two weeks I was searching for a restaurant job and this Friday I landed one ( and a good one at that. ) This is the reason I missed the last two days of my 100 days, going through the hiring process and starting along with having to learn this new menu.

But now that I have gotten the initial push out of the way I am back at the challenge and won't miss a day again.

So in the last couple days I have been talking back and forth with my client ( he had some personal issues with his partner ), which resulted in a couple last minute changes needing to be made to his website. I wrapped up all the changes he requested tonight after work and plan on showing him / hosting it tomorrow morning.

After finishing that up I started to review some C++ using a website called Firecode.io ( You should check it out if you need a place to refresh your C++ / OOP knowledge before an interview ). The idea of the website is exactly that review to nail a coding interview, kind of exactly what I needed. I plan on going through their problem set and take any notes I feel necessary. Afterwards I want to review some basic OOP principles and make notes on that as well. Anyways I think this was a good start got through about 3 or 4 problems and will be continuing tomorrow. I will write more about that in tomorrows post as I have ranted about myself enough for today LOL.

In going through even these 3 or 4 basic problems using C++ I remember how much I like coding, especially when you solve a problem. It just feels so rewarding. Along with that I really do remember how much I like C++ and the fact that it's a "Strictly typed language" as opposed to things like Javascript and Python where types aren't ever really an issue. But at the same time it makes you appreciate these loosely typed languages for their speed of development. Today I used some unordered maps to determine if each character in a given string is unique, did two other problems of this caliber, and implemented the basic Selection Sort. Good basic stuff to get myself back into things like this.

Good night, thanks for reading!
