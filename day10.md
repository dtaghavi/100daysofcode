Day 10 of 100
------------------

Day 10 complete!! One tenth of the way done!

Here comes the weekend! These are the days so far that have been the hardest for me to make take to complete these because I usually spend time with my family.

Discipline! Motivation! Goals!

At the end of each section in the course I am following, the instructor gives a little tip or inspirational speech. At the end of this one she spoke about discipline. It's weird I feel like she is reading my mind at times with the issues she addresses, but it just goes to show that the problems I've run into i.e.. lack of discipline, imposter syndrome, and many more well WE ALL EXPERIENCE THIS! Today in particular she mentioned something about discipline. In my own words and maybe a little bit of inference of my own. Don't confuse discipline and motivation. You get really motivated and start something, usually to achieve a goal of yours. Well on days where your motivation wavers or you feel like things aren't moving, this is where your discipline comes in. And so the tip she gave is to remind your self of your goals and WHY it is you are doing what you first set out to do. This is where I had an idea, that I want to get started on tomorrow.

First establish what it is my goals are. In tech, career, life, family, whatever it is. and WRITE THEM DOWN somewhere that you can look daily.

Then below each goal write out what it is you have decided for yourself, are steps to take that will help achieve this. For an example

Goal: Get in shape

Actions:
  1) Eat better
  2) Go to the gym 3 times a week
  3) etc..

I think having this written somewhere where the actions can be modified as you go would be very useful. And ultimately the reasons for this are on days where you are lacking discipline or motivation LOOK back at this goals board and see WHY you're doing what you're doing and what the actual goal is. Hey maybe the actions you are taking are no longer working, so adjust them and keep moving.

I know this is really easier said than done but I think it's a good idea and I am going to give it a shot.

Totally ASIDE from code but it was on my mind after the lesson tonight so there you go! Haha.

Today I actually learned how to fully deploy the todo list! Got mongoDB hosted using mongoDB Atlas and deployed the actual app using Heroku.
It was really quite simple ( I know I just followed the video ) but I really don't think it'd be that hard to figure out next time as well.

I'm really loving mongoDB and how well documented and simple it is to use. I could be wrong about this and it might've just been the class and myself at the time, but I remember using MySQL just being so complicated and getting annoyed.

On another note! I have an interview tomorrow for a potential junior web developer position. AND I am almost done wrapping up my FIRST real client's website ( simple static 2-3 page website ) but still, very exciting / excited that things are moving in the right direction! I have been stressing out lately since COVID and moving to Florida with no job lined up, so it is an exciting time!
