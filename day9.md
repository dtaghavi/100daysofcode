Day 9 of 100
------------------

Today went well!

Finished up todolist-v2 check out my repository for it.

Here are some of the things that I got done on it today vs the pervious commit.
I added dynamic routing by use of express routing params. So what you can do it localhost:3000 for the default "Today" todo list.
But now that I've implemented the use of routing params you can actually have multiple todo lists that are persistent because it's using a local MongoDB server.
So localhost:3000/"Whatever you want" will create a new todo list in the DB and you'll be able to add and remove things to that specific todolist.

It really sounds so basic and it is, but it still feels great to have accomplished something a bit more realistic as opposed to the previous version where it was using a static array.
But also this project has now brought together even more concepts that I have been learning about. We have dynamic pages, it uses a database, it uses EJS templates, it uses express for routing, and all the basics of HTML and CSS.

In the next challenge I will be converting the previously static version of the blog page into one that uses a database. It will be the same concept at this todo list just more practice on the same topics. My thoughts on this aside from obviously just more practice is better, is that although these things seem pretty simple, I think a lot of what you do in modern apps is just a bunch of this small stuff just on web pages with different layouts and design. So it really is exciting that I am practicing these things because really what else is it you expect to do with a database. Yes you can encrypt things and yes you can get pretty complicated relationships going and do more validation but boil it down to what it really is and this todo list really does use all of C.R.U.D.



On another note, as I continue to learn more and continue to apply for jobs I have started to feel more and more like I know nothing. The reason I say this is, the more I learn the more I learn about other technologies or languages that I have no knowledge of. I have struggled all through university with "imposter syndrome" and really, just not knowing how to rate or rank my knowledge / ability in programming. I did read somewhere that Computer Science is a field where this is quite prevalent but I'm starting to wonder if this feeling ever really goes away, even as a senior dev. There is always just SO much to learn on the subject and there's always going to be some new language or framework. I really do enjoy coding and I feel like I am pretty good, at least with the basics, but I really can't wait to get my first job and start to experience the industry.
