Day 1 of 100
------------------

So today I started off my 100 days of code.

As I mentioned on my Twitter @Dtaghavi I plan on working on @LondonBrewer 's "The Complete 2020 Web Developer Bootcamp" course which I bought on Udemy. I have already started the course prior to starting this challenge so I will just be continuing from where I am which is roughly 50% through. 

In this course I am learning in order: html, css, bootstrap, javascript, jQuery, Node.js, express, APIs, Git and Github, EJS, Databases, SQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, RESTful API, Auth & Security, React. 

Currently I am on EJS and the final challenge for this section.

After I complete this course my plan will be to take what I've learned and complete my own CV.

From there I will find more content to learn about or think to practice.

In addition to wanting to do this 100 days of Code I want to build my presence on Git hub so I will try and do AT LEAST 1 commit per day.
