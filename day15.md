Day 15 of 100
------------------

Day 15 complete.

I'm delving further into the Auth / Security so I went through one section where a couple node packages were introduced to help with Sessions. passport, passport-local, passport-local-mongoose, and express-session.

So we went through the basic setup of each and actually got our basic dummy auth website to work with it. Surprisingly there's not much code involved so it's nice, but that is four new packages! So after implementing these features I spent the rest of my time this session just reading up on some of their documentation to fill in gaps and see some other things these packages can do.

It's quite cool how Cookies work and how they store info. I still think my knowledge on the topic is severely lacking but I'm starting to understand it a bit more. ( I don't wanna write about it because I really don't know much beyond the very basic concept of it ahahah. )

Tomorrow I will be wrapping up my clients web page so I won't be progressing on this course AND in addition to this I want to freshin up on my C++, Object oriented concepts, and Data structures because my interview today went very well and could lead to something promising!

To do this review I will be looking at my old C++ labs from school, I will use firecode.io ( a good practice website for a couple languages ), and then just google some basic OOP principles and take notes.
