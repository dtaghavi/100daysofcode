Day 5 of 100
------------------

Today has been a long day but I was persistent and still got an hour of learning in today!

I was helping the family all day and stayed up way too late last night. I am exhausted but I wanted to stay strong and true to my goals, so even though not as much as I would like I got an hour of learning done. 

I don't want to sound lazy but maybe on weekends my goal will be 1hr a day where as week days I want to aim for 5-8 hrs.

I will adjust as I go, long road ahead but I am excited.
