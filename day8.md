Day 8 of 100
------------------

Today went great!

Today I had no issues with the mongoDB server and it's CLI. The last couple days were quite annoying.
The only change I had to fix was I didn't realize alias' are not permanent. SO I opened the .bash_profile and simply added them there. BOOM done.

I continued and finished the MongoDB section! And from there I started the project to bring together previous concepts and mongoDB.
Previously I made a todo list ( pretty cool actually ), but the downside is it was based on static arrays. So each time you restarted your node server you'd lose whatever was in your todo list.

Well we know about databases now! So in v2 of the todo list ( you can check it out here: https://github.com/dtaghavi/todolist-v2 ) you can now add and delete items AND it is all from a local MongoDB server! Pretty cool.

Don't have much else to mention although one thing I really like is throughout this course I have been trying to use the CLI ( command line interface ) more often to start getting used to it. ( it can be much more efficient with certain things. ) Now that I am committing to GitHub daily and everything to do with files throughout this course we use the CLI it's definitely raising my confront of it which is something that I am really quite excited about!

That's all for today! See you tomorrow!
