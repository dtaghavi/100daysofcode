Day 17 of 100
------------------

Day 17 complete!
I think all the changes have been made to my clients first website. I sent the files over to them tonight for file inspection / minor tweaks. I am very excited about it all.

So in hind sight I really wish I developed their site differently. I was a bit overwhelmed with the idea of using node and EJS and all these new things I have been learning. But now that I have continued with the course and gotten more experience it really just makes things so much easier.

I developed the site with just three static pages, so there is a lot of redundant work I made for myself.

On my next project I have a couple new insights.

1) Don't code till I have a better understanding of the clients over all needs. Purpose for the site etc...

My clients weren't really sure what they wanted and the details they gave me at the beginning was about five sentences with almost no detail. This caused me to work a lot more and I had to redo things multiple times. and A LOT of last minute changes.

2) While creating the CSS for my webpages, try to refactor as I go and minimize the amount of classes I create. What I mean is attempt to make things more universal and simple. Essentially just put more thought into everything.

I think by following my first point I will be able to lay things out better ahead of time. Which will allow me have a better plan for the classes as well.

So I guess my overall thought is just better planning ahead of time. And be more organized throughout the process.

In the end I am still happy with the product and learned a lot.
