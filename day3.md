Day 3 of 100
------------------

Third day!

Today I wrapped up the EJS challenge and committed it to Git Hub:
https://github.com/dtaghavi/ejs-blog-challenge if you wanna check it out.
Very basic personal Blog website but really taught some nice concept and brought it all together with the use of EJS and their templating. 

It really is quite incredible the power of dynamically generating pages. Instead of having to create a new page per blog post, with EJS and Node we can just use routes and their parameters to dynamically create each one based on a single template.

Other than finishing that project and committing I started on the next section which is about databases. In the previous project we just used a static array that is created on the back end ( obviously not ideal for a real blog). So we went over SQL vs NoSQL and some of the pros and cons of each. I have learned a lot about SQL from school but never used or learned much of NoSQL which I am excited about. SQL is really nice and efficient but I feel like the set-up and inflexibility of it really is a large draw back, especially for small scale personal projects that don't require to much.

Tomorrow I will be diving into the next sections where we will be using SQL using MySQL and the following section of NoSQL using MongoDB where I will get to use each and see some of the annoyances of both.
