Day 6 of 100
------------------

Tonight went well.

I started really late ( 11pm, I was having a headache all day and struggling to get going. ) but I didn't want to let this stop my momentum.

So tonight I continued along with my Web Dev course, still running through the Database section. We are using MongoDB so yesterday I learned the basic C.R.U.D ( Create, Read, Update, Destroy ) functions of mongo. Today I was learning how you would actually use Mongo with Node. So I learned that there are two ways people use usually use Mongo with a Node app and they are referred to as drivers. The Native driver and Mongoose.

Today I learned how you would use Mongo with the Native Driver of Node.js and the amount of code required to do basic things is definitely quite cumbersome ( this was the point the course wanted to make). That being said the point was also made that you do gain more control while using this method. It is not conducive to developing apps quickly but I could see why some large company might want to go down this route.

After going through that I started into the Mongoose module. I still have more to do but it is quite cool to see side by side how much time you save writing code with the help of Frameworks and libraries. I do understand that in certain situations relying on too many libraries etc.. could slow things down, but also the amount of time they save is incredible.

I really am enjoying learning more about web development and more of the technologies that people use. As I said a couple days ago, SQL is very powerful and I see the uses for it, but these NoSQL databases are just so cool to me and I really do enjoy them more ( from my current, not very vast experience ).

I'm looking forward to a new week starting tomorrow and setting aside more time throughout the week to spend solely on learning. One hour is good on weekends but seeing as my experience isn't where I want it to be in relation to what is required for a job I am glad to have the time during the week to spend 3-5 hrs learning. My goal in this regard is during my learning time try and stay more focused, don't let little distractions occur and take full advantage of that time.
