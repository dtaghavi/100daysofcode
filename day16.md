Day 16 of 100
------------------

Day 16 is complete!

I am coming down to the deadline on my first clients website, trying to wrap this thing up by Friday.

All I can say after today and working more with images and all that, a fully responsive site can be quite the head ache some times..........

What an interesting topic because just you just never really think about how much work goes into making something look good on ALL screen sizes.

I gain more and more respect and knowledge every day on the subject of developing, and I'm really becoming proud of myself for sticking to this challenge and pushing through even on days where I don't want to. Simply an hour a day min and it shocks me how much can be done in that time and how it just adds up.

Not much else to talk about today because I wasn't learning a new topic, just improving on the skills I learned earlier.

Practice makes perfect.
